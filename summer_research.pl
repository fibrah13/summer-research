Summer Research

The goal of this research is to work on Drug design for the Fibroblast Growth Factor using structural informatics.  This will be done computationally using the unix shell and the Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (PERL) as the programming language.  The program to be used in designing the drug is Hackamol::X::Vina.

Week one: - Work on familiarizing myself with Perl, the Jupyter notebook and the unix shell. Started creating z matrices of amino acids.

Week two: -  Continue constructing z matrices of the amino acids using coordinates from PDB and using VMD to visualize the structures. Also started learning to push and pull from github so there is always a back up of the files.

Introduction
Methods 

Constructing Z matrices of Amino acids.
The coordinates of the individual acids are obtained from the protein data bank on www.pdb.org. The text editor vi is then used to organize the coordinates and then visualize them in VMD. The actual bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedrals are measured and used to create new coordinates. The program trans.pl created using extensions from HackaMol is then used to translate the coordinates of the protein so that the backbone of the protein has a center of mass which is very close to zero. A program hbuild is then created again using the HackaMol extensions to place hydrogens on the amino acid molecule.
